# mailterm-go
A simple terminal email client written in Go.

Currently, the email client can handle the Gmail API, and IMAP with full support for authentication via the Gmail API. 
However, the usability of the client in the current form is somewhat limited to proof-of-concept. 

Further improvements are not guaranteed, though contributions are welcome.
